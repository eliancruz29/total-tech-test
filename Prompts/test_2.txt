Using Cursor with claude-4.5-sonnet

1 - [(main chat)] 1 - Now we are going to create a simple but powerful App to analisys requirements using generative IA. Mandatory to ignore every folder and files inside the 'Test_1' folder. All new created files and folders must be saved under 'Test_2' folder. We don't need a complex or sofisticated architecture, we just need a simple one to run the app. We must create a Web Application with just a input text to capture the software requirements from the user and then the system will send those requirements to the openrouter API (@https://openrouter.ai ) and use the DeepSeek V3.1 (free) model with this ApiKey "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" to analyze and generate the 'procesos', 'subprocesos' and 'casos de usos' for been able to meet the need from requirements, This 'procesos', 'subprocesos' and 'casos de usos' must be saved in a database which will be created base on the structure describe in the 'Diccionario_de_datos_2.md'. This sytem must use Vue.js, .NET 9 and SqlServer. The ui will have an input form but also a listing/viewing page to see the previous requirements. The API must display results while simultaneously saving to database. The App won't use authentication. For simplicity the system must run over docker for quick start up.
